# Civic Return

**Civic Return** is a browser-based tool that estimates the amount of public green space available per resident in Kentucky cities. It retrieves park geometries from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) via the Overpass API and matches population data from the U.S. Census.

Built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, the interface emphasizes clarity, emotional tone, and civic accessibility. Visualizations are self-contained, stylized to evoke an official summary cardâ€”like something you'd find mailed to a constituent.

### ðŸ”§ Status

Currently in development. Initial functions are live, including:
- Fetching park geometry from Overpass API
- Estimating square footage of green space
- Dynamic visual output for selected cities

Upcoming improvements:
- Improved city name matching for population estimates
- More robust fallbacks for complex census labels
- Layout and responsiveness polish
